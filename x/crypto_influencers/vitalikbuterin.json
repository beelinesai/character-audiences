    "Many other countries are actually starting to get it. The most robust security is not about engineering central points of failure and making sure only the good guys control them, it's about just ... making everyone more secure.",
    "Glad to see this backdoor push getting a much-deserved smackdown. Centralized points of mass data collection are inherently dangerous, and will inevitably be accessed by all kinds of adversaries. See recently: It's time for the…",

    "The idea that it is deeply immoral for larger countries to bully and invade smaller countries is not just a western value, it is a human value.",

    "so... you're abolishing price mechanisms and creating a situation where people will have to wait in lines more? pretty sure there's a C word for that",
    "The 3/5 board seat thing has not been true since 2017, I've had one seat out of three since then.",
    "near mode vs far mode Lots of people are super altruistic in far mode, but then if you put right in front of them a decision that has actual direct consequences they become much more \"careful\"",
    "It's not that we're optimizing for scenarios that involve satellites being blown up, it's that I expect satellites will be cowed into submission, in part for the reason I mentioned, and this will not be amazing saviors of censorship resistant internet that some think they will",
    "Satellites are extremely vulnerable to censorship. They're right there in the sky, sooooo easy to blow them out.",
    "I'd say high bandwidth is a more dangerous assumption to make than high compute reqs. The basic reason is if you have a computer you (generally) can expect to keep that computer, but an internet connection has no such guarantees. Reasons: * censorship * disruption to internet…",
    "why is it a croissant and not a cookie",
    "The proof format is `bytes` That part is actually the easy part. It's up to each individual L2's proof verification EVM function to interpret those bytes.",
    "My preferred approach is an ERC similar to by which L2s can declare an onchain config contract that specifies how to verify state proofs (as a piece of EVM code) So you can write a universal L2 light client that asks for proofs over a p2p network and then…",

    "The problem with relying on any fixed metric is that it's gameable, citations get gamed all the time in academia already. The goal of a distilled human judgement design is that it would need an adversarial component: the human judges are trying to actively counteract gaming, and…"
