    "Have you ever considered burying a seed phrase backup for long-term cold storage? These are my suggestions for how to do it right!",
    "\"If the app gets compromised\" being the crucial point. We have a ton of controls in place to prevent that. Mobile OS' are also generally more secure than desktops. Browser based apps, on the other hand, can be compromised in a myriad of ways.",
    "My tweets are publicly searchable; feel free to show your evidence of my shilling. I've always been interested in projects that seek to improve privacy and educate people about them. I don't tell people to invest in them.",
    "\"If exchanges can't keep coins secure, how can I?\" Buddy, North Korea isn't going to task their elite hackers with targeting your tiny stash. But if everyone keeps their cumulative billions worth of assets with a handful of custodians, guess what happens?",
    "Third party custody is just someone else's self custody. The entire problem is that you don't know which third party custody has the best practices. They are an unverifiable black box. Holding your own keys = knowing what practices are being followed.",
    "Have you ever wanted to generate a seed phrase with my own entropy but were overwhelmed by complicated guides requiring airgapped computers and command line instructions? Check out this guide for an easier solution!",
    "I don't think any form of custody can guarantee one's personal safety from wrench attacks. Your physical security and your asset security are completely different problems. Even if your assets are sufficiently outside of your immediate control, an attacker may not believe you.",
    "Former UK Secretary of Defense? Better get the military to stop using encryption so that we can be sure they're not hiding any pedophiles.",
    "Technically all custody is self custody from the perspective of the key holder. So it's not particularly helpful to call an entity that is holding money for many clients \"self custody.\"",
    "The Ledger displays incomprehensible characters when signing a multisig transaction. Because you're basically just signing a tiny message rather than committing to all the transaction details.",
    "In depth news report on one of the attackers involved in the Danbury, CT kidnapping attempt last year that was linked to a several hundred million dollar bitcoin heist.",
    "We already have merge mined sidechains. The problem is that the current state of Bitcoin scripting prevents us from creating a permissionless pegging mechanism.",
    "The nice thing about being a self custody maximalist is all you have to do is wait in order to be proven right. Again. And again. And again...",
    "Would be interesting to model it out since it basically depends upon the node connectivity but you could probably get good propagation with ~15% of nodes participating.",
    "This is why you don't leave funds with a trusted third party.",
    "Gonna be tough propagating said transactions to miners if node policy rejects transactions under that rate."
