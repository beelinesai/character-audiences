    "As I said: I want to be transparent, that is why I disclose. Also, I love pointing out the hypocrisy and dumbness of some would-be-bitcoiners, like you so clearly show with your comment \"ETFs are paper bitcoin and MSTR is completely different\". This just amuses me.",
    "You missed the point. My post is about ETF versus MSTR, the hypocrisy that ETFs are bad and MSTR is good for bitcoin. Both ETF and MSTR share holders do not have bitcoin keys. And both ETFs and MSTR have their bitcoin at Coinbase. IMO MSTR is a de facto ETF (with leverage).",
    "So when you buy bitcoin ETFs you are a retard, idiot, traitor, know nothing about bitcoin. And Larry Fink (BlackRock CEO) is the devil. But if you buy (Micro)Strategy you are a smart investor, great bitcoiner. And Michael Saylor is the Godfather of bitcoin. Make it make sense!",
    "I honestly didn't know ETFs were so controversial. In my view ETFs are a logical step in bitcoin adoption, next to holding your own keys. Out of curiosity: would it be different in your opinion if I would have bought (Micro)Strategy instead of ETF, or would that be equally evil?",
    "Netherlands has no (realized) capital gains tax, so selling is not a tax event. We have unreal capital gains tax (wealth tax): the government assumes you make ~6% return on your entire wealth (per Jan 1st) and you pay ~30% tax. So you pay ~2% of your entire net wealth, every year",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Disclosure ‚ö†Ô∏è I have transferred my bitcoin to ETFs. Yes I know, not your keys not your coins. But it is just easier for me to manage bitcoin the same way as equities and bonds. Also, not having to hassle with keys gives me peace of mind. I guess I am not a maxi anymore.",
    "Nice 500k .. with a 250k-1m range, I like itüòé",
    "each halving is exactly where the white line jumps up (2012, 2016, 2020, 2024,2028).",
    "No. In fact seasonality / price action has been like clockwork. Since 6 months before the halving (Oct 2023 close $34k) BTC price has been up 3x at Jan close ($102k), plus 9 more months to go. Note that the last part of a bull market is the steep FOMO part (and also: without‚Ä¶",
    "Red and blue tells you WHEN gains and losses are made (bull/bear), but not how high price will go. The white stair steps is het stock-to-flow (S2F) model, an attempt to estimate HOW HIGH price will go. S2F level is the average price level for a halving period. It is not very‚Ä¶",
    "All bitcoin gain is made in de red periods (6 months before a halving until 18 months after a halving). Blue periods are all in loss. We are in a red period, 9 more months (Feb-Oct)üöÄ",
    "Yup all power laws, BTC = a * X ^ b and X can be anything, time, S2F, difficulty, txs etc. I like the improvement you made, similar to  Ranges / quantiles are more useful than point estimates IMO. What is you EOY 2025 1 stdev range, 65k-260k-ish?",
    "Discrete step because S2F ratio doubles discrete in 1 block at the halving, and model value is based on S2F ratio. Also note that S2F predicts the average of a halving period (2012-2016 ave, 2016-2020 ave, 2020-2024 ave, 2024-2028 ave etc).",
    "Price action is deviated to the downside of the model (white line) after 2024 halving, but to the upside of the model after 2016 and 2012 halvings. It is never spot on. That is why we use 1 stdev ranges (2020: 25k-100k and 2024 250k-1m). 2020-2024 average was 34k, in range. But‚Ä¶",
    "I love time models (grey line) simple, smooth, nice fit. However after 2016 halving I became more intrigued by the fact that all bitcoin gain is concentrated around halvings (red). I based my 2019 S2F thesis (white line) on it. 2020 halving confirmed that pattern! 2024 halvingü§û",
    "No. There are 2 other models (not to replace it but make the argument stronger): 1) 288k S2FX model, based on gold and silver (to counter time series arguments, auto-regression, cointegration etc) 2) 100k pre-2012 model, based on only 4 data points before any halving (to counter‚Ä¶",
    "Last cycle S2F target was ~50k with 25k-100k range. Average cycle price came in ~34k, well within range. If that is \"missed the mark badly\" for you then fine. For me it's good enough, and I am looking forward to 2024-2028 target of ~500k average (with 250k-1m range).",
    "What 4 months (Feb-May) with +40% return would look like. Note that each prior bull market (2013, 2017, 2020/21) had at least 4 months with +40% return...",
    "Here is the same chart in linear. Now you can not compare or see anything anymore...",
    "IMO it is certain that the bull market will end and transition into the distribution phase. This will happen gradually (like 2017), after face melting FOMO (like 2013), or abruptly after something bad happened. Personally I will never sell all, but I will rotate and re-balance a‚Ä¶",
    "S2F seems to imply the end of the US dollar at some point in the future. So either USD will die or S2F will die. BTW historically USD has had a very long run as reserve currency, so IMO it is not unthinkable to have it replaced by a world reserve currency something."
