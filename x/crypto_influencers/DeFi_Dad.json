    "There’s lots of great builders too. I 100% count myself in a long term Solana camp still but the prevailing sentiment to win at all costs (from some) is so gross.",
    "Ethereum didn’t get hacked retard",
    "Kills me  was one of the real ones who had real insight to weigh in Nearly 99% of the rest is bullshit",
    "Endless farming of engagement 🤡 show",
    "He’s a shithead. More evidence why I have always had a hard time wanting to get aligned with the Solana cabal — these guys have wanted to kill Ethereum at any cost. There’s no grace, or humility or empathy or humanity. Clearly no ethics for some. He’s a major influence on the…",
    "If I have to read one more chatgpt generated, yap-chasing thread on… “This is how $1.4B was just hacked” Even though only a few actually had the expertise to assess the situation onchain It’s same energy as the BREAKING NEWS accounts that just repost every headline. PLEASE…",
    "It’s one of the most just results over the years, seeing dishonest people like Samson, and other shitheads (Grubles another) not only lose, but in an epic way. I really don’t entertain such negative feelings for anyone else except these unethical lying scumbags.",
    "You should get back to building Cuckstream.",
    "Another with giga-virgin energy to filter out of your feed is Tuur 🤮",
    "They’re a lost cause, Jeff. But thanks for trying. Just by saying what you did, means you’re not a “real Bitcoiner” for the laser-eyed bros. Curious if some of them will start tweeting we should “roll back Bitcoin” once NK sells some ETH into BTC.",
    "At Mount Sunapee in New Hampshire and my god, NH people are so nice. People here know how to live. One of the best states in the 🇺🇸",
    "I haven’t looked at a post from this loser in years but for those new here… Blockstream was/is/continues to be the biggest Bitcoin maxi failure of the decade raising over $200M and no product market fit—one of the earliest Ethereum killers smart contract platforms that never…",
    "This place is a cesspool of people so broken and ethically compromised they must be mentally ill or evil. To this day, Bitcoin maxis still host a majority of the dumbest people in crypto, who also believe they’re extraordinary.",
    "Trolling cuz he wishes there was enough funds on his CEX that NK would want to hack them 😇",
    "What if ETH goes up in meantime? 🤡 despite it being a cursed asset",
    "I reasoned the same thing but CT tells me somehow either they won’t buy ETH, or if they do, NK will sell over many years so it cancels out… Or Vitalik will print new ETH on the masternode… Or the world will nuke itself if anyone ever buys ETH in size… No matter what I’m…",
    "Perfectly timed new  hours before the largest CEX hack—just like we planned, right  👀",
    "Almost comically sad what anyone will do to avoid buying ETH",
    "The demeanor of the  founder + fact he wears a WHOOP… I’m impressed",
    "Stolen ETH only represents 1/25 of total AUM. The size of  is mind boggling 🤯 Meanwhile Ethereum Mainnet is not affected",
    "Is $1.4B Really Enough to Retire? Good blog post title ;)",
    "Bullish Bybit buying ETH soon 🐂",
    "Oof--could be AI tools to stop fraud or something, it constantly creates issues."
