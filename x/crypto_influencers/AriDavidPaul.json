    "I go back and forth on this a lot. X is just a method of interacting with “the world” (obviously a thin slice of it, but still infinitely broader than I interact with at a tradfi conference or in small crypto operator circles.) And whenever I interact with “the world” (or more…",
    "You’re an embarrassment to Palestinians. He said that while kidnapped by Hamas under torture and threat of being murdered like so many other kidnapped civilians…and Hamas openly celebrated the toddlers deaths with victory parades. Is Hamas’ murder of innocents “moral jihad”…",
    "? Just Google it. Israel embraced Palestinian statehood in 1948. One doesn’t exist because Arab league voted no. Want to guess why? You’re promoting propaganda that just exploits Palestinians and keeps them stateless. Keep spreading your mindless hate and virtue signaling…",
    "To be fair, Musk and Trump have stated that officially Musk has no authority, doesn’t run Doge, and has no legal accountability or authority around these orders. The “schrodinger’s boss.” The boss when giving orders, not the boss if anything goes wrong or is criminal. Curious…",
    "Huh? Your claim is that the proud boy’s are liberal? What bizarre “gaslighting” as you say. Trump pardoned them (why if they were deep state libs), after they led the capitol invasion to change the election outcome for Trump (according to them.) Is Trump in on this conspiracy…",
    "3/ we did have a sharp rise in crash fatalities and large aircraft crashes, it’s not a fabricated story. But nor is it as simple as I framed it in a tweet.",
    "2/ I’ll help you out: the place I’m showing bias is in my core claim that plane crashes suddenly rocketed. By numerical count, they haven’t. We’re all hearing more about plane crashes due to media bias and “liberals” looking to pile on. Reality, we have very few data points…",
    "How so? What argument did I make that wasn’t purely based on raw data? I’ll note your argument *requires* bias, since the data doesn’t fit the argument. You have to invent a key variable to create a fact pattern where none exists in the data itself. Again, crashes and…",
    "The irony…you’re replying in a thread quote tweeting a Palestinian…the hateful propaganda is just used to exploit and prey on Palestinians. Why don’t Palestinians have a state despite one being created and Israel embracing it in 1948? Because the of the argument that Israel…",
    "Why do you think it’s the right today more openly embracing naziism? Proud boys as one example among many.",
    "Such a craven evil argument (even if it was true, which it’s not.) This is an embarrassment to all the decent Palestinians.",
    "Agree, except I don’t know who taints who more by association…",
    "That’s not how OFAC or the law works. And vitalik and EF have no ability to push a HF, anymore than Blockstream can push through a bitcoin HF.",
    "Bitcoin started worth zero, then a fraction of a pizza, then $1, etc. Obviously could launch a bitcoin2 and bitcoin3 at the same time. Initial value at launch (same with bitcoin) should reflect network effects and peoples’ speculative belief it will eventually be a SoV.…",
    "Everything is culturally biased…what term or concept would you replace it with in this convo for more productive discussion? The reason IQ never got replaced with anything “acceptable” is the same reason words for “bad things” rotate (like undertaker, mortician, funeral…",
    "Intellectual executive too. Same effect with pro chess players etc.",
    "Sorry, I got 1/3 of the way through and didn’t see any reference to sudden changes in the last month. Could you point me to the specific paragraph that addresses our discussion in some way? Do you think the falling rate of crashes and fatalities from 2004-2024 challenges your…",
    "What makes you think it’s false? We can prove it pretty easily…Musk’s actions and results are largely public. Someone could argue there was a secret super genius behind Musk the whole time but then that burden would be on that person to at least suggest a name, let alone…",
    "Not assuming anything. Unlike the biographer apparently, I observed Musk’s strategy unfold in real-time over 20 years with interest. Who do you think the real brains are behind Musk if that’s your hypothesis?",
    "Again, I’m an outspoken critic who calls musk a fraud, a pathological liar etc. no charity. Just basic realism from someone with a little experience in business. Musk’s companies didn’t succeed, they outpaced competitors 10x+ to make him the richest man in the world. Plenty…",
    "Show us your clear thinking, no need to be coy. What else changed in the last month?"
