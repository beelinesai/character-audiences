    "for everyone that might be tricked into reading your clearly worthless biography, feel free to read the actually good walter isaacson biography -&gt;",
    "can i get a job at the SEC now?",
    "it's me. I'm the psychic (ordinary person that can spot a fraud). note the date",
    "You are generally right that crypto people were generally too accepting of the fantastical claims made by TFL/Do Kwon, but I think we should be clear about the sequencing and history here.",
    "There are ~no examples of the Gensler SEC stepping in and stopping a meaningful, damaging fraud before it collapsed or was exposed. But plenty of examples of the Gensler SEC going after ordinary law abiding businesses. There's no rewriting this history.",
    "The SEC subpoenaing Do Kwon in 2021 is not a feather in their cap. They went after Terra over the mirror protocol (synthetic equities called mAssets) and entirely missed the actual fraud/scam. They belatedly sued TFL in 2023 long after UST had collapsed. Jake is right.",
    "Where were the bank lobbyists when OCP2.0 was going on? Either way, better late than never",
    "big fellow kids energy",

    "I remember his posts on Reddit lol",
    "This is an insane card wow",
    "I’m not against Sol at all, in fact I’ve done more defi deals in Solana than Eth in the last 12 months",
    "I own no ordinals. Taproot wizards don’t even exist. Anyway, total non sequitur. Ordinals have nothing to do with memecoins and they don’t compete for attention",
    "I’m not making the comparison. Just think there’s going to be legal attacks on all these venues. And probably for good reason",
    "I’m not comparing to FTX. Read better",
    "What do I have to do with ordinals lol? I own 0",
    "Not comparing it to FTX myself. Obviously very different. Think their privileged access to memecoin informational flow will be scrutinized. Meteora cofounder already resigned",
    "Diff is some leadership seems to be implicated. I guess sort of like opensea but that was a junior employee"
