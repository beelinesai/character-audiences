    "Thank you! I think others like Elon did far more fwiw, but glad to have played a part. Tobi, Alex Wang, etc also helped on DEI, and a number of other crypto firms have pushed back on regulatory overreach. The more the better.",
    "Are you not getting prompt enough responses, your account got restricted, or what is the main concern? We measure these and they are improving so just curious",
    "Amazing - congrats to",
    "Appreciated this interview with  to highlight the SEC staff agreeing to dismiss their case against Coinbase",
    "Agreed! Your case is also totally baseless as far as I can tell. They should drop it.",
    "Great news! After years of litigation, millions of your taxpayer dollars spent, and irreparable harm done to the country, we reached an agreement with SEC staff to dismiss their litigation against Coinbase. Once approved by the Commission (which we're told to expect next week)…",
    "On memecoins… Memecoins have generated a lot of buzz recently, and I’ve gotten some questions on how I think about them. I am personally not a memecoin trader (beyond a few test trades), but they’ve become hugely popular. Arguably, they've been with us since the beginning –…",
    "Wow impressive. And love the transparency. Will you raise fund size or keep the same?",
    "Excited for  to have such a great partner!",
    "These are foundational freedoms that crypto provides. A bipartisan majority in Congress passing market structure and stablecoin legislation for crypto will enshrine these freedoms for all Americans.",
    "Gotta admit you were right on this lol I did not think they would get around to doing this so soon (it’s a good idea! Just took courage to finally do it)",
    "Welcome  to AgentKit!",
    "The key attribute I look for in hiring for these companies is \"builders\" who thrive in ambiguity. Can they prototype solutions in days, not weeks, and then refine them with a sense of urgency.",
    "We're using AI in many ways at  (fraud prevention, customer support, risk scoring, design, and 100% of engineers have onboarded to Cursor) but the next step is every ticket in Jira/Linear should have a draft PR attached that was auto generated by AI based on the…",
    "xAI is proof that we can all get more done in a year than we think. Time to amp it up.",
    "The companies I'm working on have ambitious missions (economic freedom at Coinbase, extending human healthspan at NewLimit, and accelerating scientific research at ResearchHub). The through line here is these are my best ideas to accelerate civilizational progress."
