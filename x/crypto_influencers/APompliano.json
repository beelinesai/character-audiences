    "I am not a gold hater, but I do believe that bitcoin is superior. Gold bugs should be excited that gold has expanded its market cap, while bitcoin has grown so successfully. This means the combined addressable market is much larger than most previously thought.",
    "Berkshire Hathaway has paid $101 billion in taxes over the last 60 years. Incredible.",
    "A simple thesis for bitcoin at the moment is \"the largest pools of capital don't own bitcoin, but eventually they will own a lot of bitcoin.\"",
    "Gold has outperformed bitcoin over the last 30 days, but bitcoin is destroying the precious metal over the last 5 years. Bitcoin +866% Gold +78%",
    "Worth reading. This story explains so much of the last 30 years in business, tech, and investing.  nailed it with this one.",

    "This would be an excellent idea",
    "Seek risk. Embrace volatility. Ignore the opinions of others. Pursue the unpopular ideas. Everything you want in life comes from leaving your comfort zone.",
    "The people who believe this are always the ones who have no skills, no unique ideas, and could not build anything of real value. They are telling on themselves.",
    "The lack of quality coming from most foreign-made products that aspire to be the cheapest option actually ends up costing consumers more in the long run. Think of how few high-quality goods you own that can be passed down to future generations compared to your grandparents.",
    "We are exactly 2 days away from Bitcoin Investor Week in NYC. Speakers include:",
    "Worth reading. It will help you understand why and how information is shared in modern society.",
    "What was the best thing you read, watched, or listened to this week? Any topic is fair game.",
    "Calling the intervention of government a “market-based approach” is doing A LOT of work here.",
    "The market has assigned 24% chance that we will get a recession this year. Do you agree?",
    "SGT Mark Baum was killed 16 years ago today. Never forgotten.",
    "I joined  this morning to discuss bitcoin's prospects in 2025 and why clear regulatory rules will be a major tailwind for the crypto industry.",
    "This data seems way off. Thoughts?",
    "Bitcoin is up 100% in the last year!"
