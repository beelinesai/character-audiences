    "2017 VCs dumping on ICOs 2020 DeFi rug pulls 2024 Meme coin pump and dumps That‚Äôs the last 3 cycles in crypto. It normally takes 3 mistakes for people to learn. This is why BTC dominance is climbing back to its proper equilibrium.",
    "You can look at Ft Knox custodying gold for other sovereigns as a parallel. 1) geopolitical signal of confidence + ties to the US. 2) it takes a long time for internal processes to be sufficiently battle hardened even if technology for institutional custody exists.",
    "On this topic‚Ä¶ Vend diagrams are enlightening, literally.",
    "The main question is who will hack the 3,700,000 BTC that‚Äôs lost? Google, NSA, China, some new quantum computing venture? This is a $350B lost treasure salvage operation. Will be trillions soon. Hence lost BTC will eventually accelerate funding into quantum computing.",
    "Every chart tells a story. ETHBTC captured 2 of the 3 bubbles, lost the third to SOL (the current memecoin bubble) XRPBTC is a series of pump and dumps by whale insiders.",
    "Is digital gold? That misses the point, the key is how is it created? Bitcoin is a meme so strong that it's a squatter living rent free in people‚Äôs minds. After a while there‚Äôs only 2 paths: you buy it and become rich or you keep hating and turn crazy.",
    "Lambos are a crypto thing, originating from the 2017 shitcoin fast money bubble, it‚Äôs not Bitcoin.",
    "The first step in learning how Ripplenet works is the knowledge that XRP is not needed for facilitating transactions. If you want to own a slice of the network then you‚Äôd need to have shares in Ripple Labs. They make money dumping their 80% pre-mined XRP on retail.",
    "Dear CEO of XRP, living in the US, tell me which countries would buy US-controlled XRP if the strategic reserve needed to be put to work. BTC is a geopolitically neutral asset like Gold. You‚Äôre gaslighting people into thinking XRP is a strategic reserve asset.",
    "‚ÄúIf capital flows follow through‚Äù let‚Äôs see after these liquidations.",
    "Capital inflows into the Bitcoin network starting to climb again, while BTC chops around sideways quietly hiding coins being accumulated. It's not a bad setup to explore all time highs if capital inflows follow through this week.",
    "Every coin has a story. Circa 2015 XRP was Low volumes allowed their trading team to manipulate the price up while systematically dumping their 100% pre-mine onto retail who believed it was the next payment network. To reinforce this grift, Ripple signed 100s of hot air‚Ä¶",
    "On this week 10 years ago. Some things never change (1), others are always changing (2-20).",
    "üíØ XRP is satan's little helper.",
    "Investing is Cantillion, you are partaking literally in the creation of new money. Trading is the process of arbitrage where valuations become efficient so the former can prosper. 99% of participants lose money for the greater good, unbeknownst.",
    "If it's \"go\", bare in mind nothing is immediate. Would take in the range of 6-24 months before the US Govt could execute on BTC stacking. Nevertheless the markets would start a process of speculative front running.",
    "The Bitcoin Strategic Reserve needs buy in from Congress and the House, issuing an executive order on inauguration day is the blunt way to execute this. The smart way is to assess the likelihood of success before pushing the go button. That's my guess at the BSR status.",
    "I'm not convinced we'll have nation states in 100 years. Hunter Gatherer -&gt; Tribes Agrarian -&gt; Kingdoms &amp; Empires Industrial -&gt; Nation States Digital -&gt; A mesh of City States??",
    "Nothing is static, we are in a phase change. Zoom out 100 years. End system may look like: BTC 21M Global GDP ~21M Equities ~21M Crypto maybe subset of Equities valuation Fiat 0, nada, it dies or civilisation collapses",
    "Never underestimate humanity's need for humour.",
