    "but note the  the seed escrow feature is opt-in. it won't do it unless you opt-in.",
    "we have also a feature for the opposite: anti-exfil, where the companion app (smartphone/desktop wallet) can jam the subliminal channels within signatures to prevent a firmware hacked HWW from leaking seeds via signatures. for that to help you'd generate seed with dice say",
    "well that was another topic alright. i think it was a surprise to many that a HWW firmware update could exfil seed material, but it's generaly possible, if the wallet provider is not trusted. what we do at  is FOSS firmware updates no auto-update so people can verify.",
    "nothing wrong with  for cold storage. eth evm is just systemically terrible security architecture. hard for the HWW to patch around that.",
    "it's not a good idea to talk about bitcoin holdings.",
    "ofc. everyone is pro-btc.",
    "people are still doing post-mortems, but so far it sounds like the safe(wallet) UI was hacked on exchange laptops, and/or safe(wallet) backend hacked, but in either case the  HWW doesn't warn LOUDLY that the contract is about to be replaced on the cold wallet. it should.",
    "yes.  CEO says he signed last multisig with a ledger via UI controlled by safe(wallet) in this Q&amp;A video earlier. that's why ledger is putting out PR about \"clear sign\" as their solution. ledger also has HSM products which maybe different.",
    "it's definitely a potential strategy - exhaust security researchers with a dust storm. or pre-planned routing through a byzantine mix of bridges, other chains, AMMs etc. the fan-out can get big, and much of it not seizable. USDC would be if they are fast",
    "but it's a bit of a losing game and many funds un-recovered, converted to BTC, or sit in limbo or slowly drained over time, for prior blind-signing similar hacks.",
    "I was just asking  if he had views on the hackers routing via USDC and chances of that being recovered. lots of exchanges and security people and HWW providers, safe wallet etc are no doubt getting little sleep right now trying to track and seize any fragments they can",
    "eth virtual machine. it's the silly VM they self-designed instead of using something existing and robust. naive inexperienced developers bent on reinvented wheels. but badly.",
    "i guess if they split the wallet into 10 cold wallets, they would likely have noticed the first 40,000 ETH having the smart-contract reassigned.",
    "should note  was using safe wallet multisig, which is apparently what many others are using as well. but that's not really a good defense as the whole point of a cold wallet is to NOT rely on information displayed on laptops, as they can be hacked or have malware.",
    "since the previous ETH blind-signing HWW hacks,  has been working on \"clear sign\" for select contracts to display what you're approving on the HWW like BTC always has, but i dont think it's widely available yet presumably or still in development.",
    "the ledger multisig actually approved replacing the cold wallet smart-contract with one giving the hackers ownership of the whole 400,000 ETH cold wallet ($1.4bil). now yes they probably hacked some laptops or servers, BUT this is what HWW are supposed to prevent.",
    "EVM contracts are too complicated and resource intensive to be properly verified or the effect displayed on a hardware wallet. (unlike so what happend with  is they thought they were doing a 30,000 ETH withdraw, signed on  HWW; but instead they",
    "it's whackamole through a dozen bridges, AMMs, exchanges etc. apparently they're cycling into BTC - everyone wants just surprised to see them cycling via USDC. stablecoins are seizable, and they do seize if presented credible info by law enforcement or exchanges.",
    "(ie the hackers strategy there seems dumb, not zach!)",
    "yes it's an EVM mis-design problem dating back years. this is the 4th blind-signing root cause EVM hack in as many months. people just don't care any more. and dominance just keeps ratching higher $BTC.D up 50% in 30months.",
    "fix this shit. reinstate",
    "as rising and pushing $99k before the unrelated  \"yet another .eth blind-signing\" hack, 4th in as many months. nothing to do with bitcoin.",
    "aren't any  hack proceeds routed via USDC gonna get seized?  seems dumb",
    "yes under valued IMO."
