    "Another wake-up call! Digital asset security must be taken seriously. Institutions cannot ignore proper governance and hardware security. Talking my own book... ...But  Enterprise is paramount and core to the ecosystem.",
    "Revolution? What F-ing revolution? Crytpo guys getting let into the  building! Thanks to NYSE Wired's John Baumann for inviting me to be the first guest on their Crypto Trailblazers Series. Lively chat with   coming out soon. Wen crytpo public? ðŸš€",
    "Still more of a venture project. Hasn't achieved network effect yet. Maybe just needs more time and usage.",
    "Getting lots of good feedback on this podcast. Maybe it's the clear glasses. Maybe it's the smell of napalm in the morning. Who knows. Imparted some new ideas. Happy to share views on bitcoin, eth, digital assets and the current incredible environment.",
    "Not interested in others. US has always been isolationist. Others will follow out of necessity.",
    "Nothing can stop and idea whose time has come. Do not be surprised to see the new American revolution peacefully transfer to foreign shores. Might take some time. But Europe first. Maybe Russia second. Then China. Freedom and the money of freedom, bitcoin, a powerful tonic.",
    "That's a lot of work you put into this thread.",
    "I ignore all of this. It's a waste of time. Patience and inactivity can be a superpower.",
    "ETF are temporary bridge not final point.",
    "Really feel this is off base. Base.",
    "Let's think about this for a second. The new Comptroller of the Currency of the United States used to work at a bitcoin mining company that invests in cryptocurrency projects. Let's let that sink in. It's 2025 and the future is now. Bull mkt has not yet even gathered steam.",
    "Cone back to me in a few months...not hours.",
    "Not sure. Go to  website....maybe they post something.",
    "Thanks Jonnie. I am sure you are right. If it's an interesting enough observation, it will eventually find it's way. Also, I usually just save interesting charts and prefer to put my own spin on them.",
    "True! ...And greatest force for productivity boom."
