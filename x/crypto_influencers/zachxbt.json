    "I spent the entire day graphing out the laundering movements and flagged theft addresses. I am making 920+ addresses connected to the Bybit hack publicly available here: (the data may need to be cleaned up a bit)",
    "It’s not as easy as it sounds bc they are typically only risking $50-100K per txn at an exchange where it can be frozen and are avoiding this as much as possible by using bridges, OTCs, noncompliant exchanges. You have to also factor in the seizure process as well which takes…",
    "Thanks for confirming",
    "sorry typo it should read “funding of test addresses\"",
    "The funding test addresses for Bybit were also connected to Phemex as I stated yesterday and there are other indicators I cannot post publicly. If you actually followed Lazarus hacks on you would know they commonly do this (see examples). Although I guess it might be hard to…",
    "Perhaps if you actually mapped out the the hundreds of transfers instead of typing on X you would see for yourself",
    "At a minimum it proves the same entity was involved with all three of these hacks.",
    "Lazarus Group just linked an address tied to the BingX hack to this same cluster a few minutes ago which now connects the Bybit, BingX, &amp; Phemex hacks on-chain. Overlap 0xd555789b146256253cd4540da28dcff6e44f6e50 Bybit hack txn:…",
    "They don’t care about being caught bc meaningless when it’s a nation state threat actor",
    "Before this activity was observed just now myself and Josh from CF found the Bybit testing addresses connected to laundering on Tron for the Phemex hack along with other indicators shared,to earn a bounty from Arkham 12 hrs ago.",
    "A nation state threat actor hacked a tier 1 exchange and stole $1.46B and it’s being equivocated to a bunch of gamblers who willingly chose to invest in meme coins. Meanwhile any amount of common sense can easily identify meme coins as rugs/scams.",
    "Lazarus Group just connected the Bybit hack to the Phemex hack directly on-chain commingling funds from the intial theft address for both incidents. Overlap address: 0x33d057af74779925c4b2e720a820387cb89f8f65 Bybit hack txns on Feb 22, 2025:…",
    "Proceeds to post my DMs immediately after I decline when I didn’t have to reply to you at all. I think I made the right choice.",
    "Kyle/Su blew up a multi billion dollar fund last cycle and were later caught deceiving lenders. If you deposit $1M to an exchange operated by them and get frozen after that’s completely your own fault and not my problem. Low iq entitled people like yourself who lack common…",
    "it’s fake news bc they are asleep rn",
    "Partial recovery is more common (15-30% in a good scenario?) but it’ll also be a bit harder to launder $1.46B I think depending on how patient they are. For recent hacks Lazarus has mainly just been spamming funds to Chinese exchanges on different chains where it eventually…",
    "TLDR myself and Josh from CF connected the Bybit hack on-chain to the Phemex hack",
