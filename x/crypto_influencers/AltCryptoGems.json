    "$LUMIA on the move. Seems to be forming a deviation and reclaiming the Binance listing price. Do you know what this means? We have gotten rid of all the weak hands, and we are now ready to move!",
    "Request - $HBAR ðŸ“Š Not doing much lately, so my suggestion here is to wait a bit. We either enter on a clean reclaim of that support level or down at that demand level. Right now attention is elsewhere, but I am pretty sure $HBAR will shine again!",
    "Request - $VELO ðŸ“Š Kind of a big indecision time here. Squeezing in a flag just at this macro mid-range. I would be vigilant and ready as soon as this flag breaks. Seems like it's getting ready for a move!",
    "Do you think Jack Dorsey is the creator of Satoshi Nakamoto? Rumours are swirling, and weâ€™d love to hear your thoughts. $BTC",

    "Definitely, patience pays off in the long run!",
    "Appreciate it! waiting for confirmation is key to a safe entry!",
    "Watching it too! A reclaim could be a great entry."
