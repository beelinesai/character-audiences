    "I guess … but it will create a second Ethereum Classic … they definitely don’t want that",
    "Yes, that's why I highly doubt they'll do it again. The fact that they did it once is why they are being mocked by both BTC and SOL. Explanation for why I think they'll never do it again here:",
    "Yeah, I’m just saying this Bitcoin dev did, and it created a big controversy.",
    "Your question reminds me of when someone suggested something for the Binance hack. Doing something like that would create such a controversy that it would likely lead to some kind of fork. (See: The DAO.) Even the suggestion of it would set off a firestorm.",
    "Or I should say I would be shocked if they did.",
    "Ethereum is not going to do anything.",
    "There’s a lot more nuance here than what I remembered when I wrote the tweet but when I wrote it, I assumed he was joking because I knew he was a fan. I then put the screenshots from my book because they would give everyone a full explanation of why Ethereum would not hard fork…",
    "I asked Arthur if he was joking because it was obvious that Ethereum would not do this. But also because I remembered that he is a fan of Ethereum — see these bits of a transcript from an interview I did with him and one more screenshot in the next tweet.",
    "They’re obviously trying to undermine ETH. I already explained “I’m sure” Ethereum wouldn’t hard fork. Is your issue just that I didn’t say it in a standalone tweet?",
    "No, I used to own crypto when I worked at Forbes since they have a policy that you can cover something you own as long as you disclose. But other publications have a policy you can’t own, and when I quit, I wanted to be able to write for any publication. But even then some of…",
    "Awww, Jill, that’s so sweet. Thank you 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 It also means a lot right now because I am getting attacked by people from every chain nowadays 😂",
    "Ah, well, I think V and JR differ on key political and health related issues, so it might be an awkward conversation 😂",
    "Shouldn’t it be Vitalik?",
    "Yes, appears to be the rumor",
    "This happened to someone close to me and the doctor basically took a bad situation and threw gallons of gasoline on it and lit match with these drugs. And no -- no explanation. Their motto is: First, do the maximum amount of harm possible",
    "was not expecting this 👀",
    "You take issue with the fact that I wrote replies and not standalone tweets? (The one to Arthur is on one of the biggest crypto accounts.) Next time I will submit all my tweets to you in advance for approval",
    "I did a couple days ago:",
    "You clearly haven't read my book. All of that info, minus the bit on the bitcoin rollback, which I knew about but just isn't in my book since it's not a history of Bitcoin, is my book. So I reported all that ... THREE YEARS AGO",
    "😂 I was like, whoa, how did i not see or hear anything about this?!",
    "It's a different kind of \"bull\" market 😂"
