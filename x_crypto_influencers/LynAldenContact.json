    "My current hobby sci manuscript actually focuses on this. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you do?‚Äù ‚ÄúI uh, wanted to fix the problem.‚Äù ‚ÄúSee that dead guard? Her name was Regina. It was her first day on the job. She was about to get married.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I mean, Jeez. It‚Äôs rough. I admit.‚Äù",
    "I like stories where the hero actually struggles with their kills. Like, they kill a ton for a good purpose, but then actually face psychic consequences for taking a ton of human lives face to face so easily. Since that more closely mirrors the real world and audience.",
    "Almost every real hero we know in history has a crazy kill count. Same for literature. Legolas and Gimli literally compete on enemy kill counts, but are depicted as though they‚Äôre still reasonably adjusted friendly non-psychopathic people. Like that‚Äôs a normal thing to do.",
    "A lot of heroes in movies and books kill a ton of enemy people, but then are like ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt kill the head villain, I‚Äôm too principled for that.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúLuke, you already killed a thousand janitors on the Death Star. It had to be done. It‚Äôs already ethically awkward.‚Äù üßµ",
    "Not the worst take. Not the best take. But also not the worst take.",
    "Men who mature further likely aren‚Äôt on Twitter enough to post here. They‚Äôre likely too busy touching grass, getting women, or otherwise winning at things.",
    "Sometimes we have to go hard. Fintwit isn‚Äôt the same without Rudy or Larry.",
    "I woke up and chose friends.",
    "Well, let's see if our effort makes a difference. I hope it will. And I'll keep pushing.",
    "I helped spread it among big accounts by putting it on my main 700k+ feed, with context. If one of my friends gets hit, I go fucking all-out. But I didn't start it. Thanks to  for putting it on my radar.",
    "MAGS is super legit. She knows Lawrence in person.",
    "Big fan of your work.",
    "Hey  another 200k+ account CEO also knows this is Lawrence's account. It's a funny big social chain now, which matters these days. There's a big legit swarm that says Lawrence really is Lawrence. And we're willing to help verify, or annoy until he's back here.",
    "Friends support friends. In a world of disinformation, chains or social graphs of truth matter.",
    "She's right  That account is really Lawrence Lepard. I know him in person. Happy to verify.",
    "Hey  the chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation knows Lawrence in person. Lawrence is a good man. Based man. Please restore. I know Lawrence in person too. He's legit. There are accounts with collectively millions of followers saying they know him.",
    "Another 50k+ account supports the  account as legit. And that's a professional philosopher who I know in person, which is better than my amateur analyst ass.  please help Larry get access to his account. Happy to help verify it's him if needed.",
    "Larry is great. I elevated it to my my main feed.",
    "I don't know all his details, but from what little I know, I don't want to see him in prison.",
    "Putting this on my main feed. This Lawrence Lepard account is legit  I know Lawrence in person. One of the kindest people around. Please restore his account if possible. Happy to help personally verify if needed.",
    "If anyone on Twitter contacts me to help validate Larry‚Äôs identity, I‚Äôm happy to do so. Putting that out there. Great guy. Great book, too."
