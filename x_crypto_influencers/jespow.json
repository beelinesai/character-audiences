    "Itâ€™s not helping that theyâ€™re denying housing to entrepreneurs who could bring jobs back.",
    "I have a feeling that it's worse than USAID. Money is just max buying more magnets for criminals and drug addicts. Then, they come back saying they need more money for all the criminals and drug addicts they want to take care of. Then, they take more money and buy more magnets.",
    "Muni, BART and Caltrain do not need further subsidies. People don't ride because the stations and cars are dangerous and gross. Can you imagine taking BART to the Symphony right now? Clean up the cars, the stations and the walk to the destinations, and people will ride again.",
    "I wonder if these guys get physical threats and we just need a higher power to come in and reset the game. Cartels might have total control of local politicians.",
    "100% correct take and very well laid out. The attack itself is harmless if you ignore it. The harm comes from agitating a bunch of dormant antibodies that are tricked into attacking the healthy organs, ultimately resulting in the death of the entire body.",
    "Great views, and I'd love to attend fundraisers for Dems (and anyone else) supportive of crypto. Hopefully, they'll figure out that, in San Francisco, it's ok to live amongst people with different ideas, sources of income and backgrounds. I feel bad for the trapped sellers!",
    "Happened to me, as well. Sometime around mid 2022 when I started commenting on woke insanity. How'd you get someone to review your account for this badge? Do you know if they all got wiped out after the sale?",
    "Denial of Service. Oh, you donâ€™t have a spare $100m of resource to answer our questions? Guess we canâ€™t get comfortable with your business idea.",
    "Ambidongxtrous. Genius. Why would you settle for a 1x man when you could be 2x man?",
    "What if it doesnâ€™t identify as a leg?",
    "Instead of a phalloplasty, you could just identify as being 1-legged + extremely well-endowed.",
    "It's definitely a skill, and there is clearly value in having the patience and temperament to hold somebody's hand as they navigate new technology.",
    "I once interviewed an office manager candidate who was extremely confident, said she ran IT for her whole office (a law firm). Unfortunately, she bombed the actual test that a 12yo would pass blindfolded. Turns out, \"IT\" was mostly helping 80yo lawyers use iPhone apps.",
    "What's funny about that?",
    "Hey,  hire these guys. It's a solid 2-for-1. You give jobs to all these unemployed home builders who know how to get shelter and electricity up quickly. You'll rebuild the Palisades in a week. cc:",
    "The lawyers are already on the case",
    "You know it better than anyone, unfortunately. War is a grind but we are on the precipice of victory. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
    "First they denied the crypto industry banking, now they deny us housing.  I was happy you got elected and I really wanted to come back and make a difference in San Francisco. The time for political fights is over. The nation and city spoke. Let's rebuild together.",
    "Thank you for covering the story. Given our housing crisis in CA, and especially in SF, I'm confident courts will agree that co-ops can't arbitrarily and indefinitely block sales and hold units vacant. These actions cause harm to the entire state. Next stop is the legislature.",
    "You took a lot of arrows for this, risked your own life, even. Congratulations and thank you.",
    "Thank you! Agreed. Regardless of the outcome of this case, I'm going to the legislature. We have a housing shortage and this selfish behavior has significant externalities and socialized harm. We will make it clear that HOAs cannot discriminate on any basis other than financials."
