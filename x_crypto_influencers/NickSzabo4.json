    "I've been excited to investigate my whiteness. Why wouldn't a white be excited to investigate their whiteness? What I discovered is that my particular whiteness is pretty damned good. I have great ancestors. Hope to have great descendants. I love my whiteness, why wouldn't you?",
    "The most important thing we are supposed to remember is oxymoronic nonsense?",
    "Some are more alternate than others.",
    "They can't do this without draconian, devastating bans on the IC competition.",
    "Where is your evidence for this bullshit hallucination?",
    "Cultural appropriation.",
    "Does that include getting people fired for saying the wrong thing or studying the wrong subjects? Because in the real world getting worked up over ambiguous, shifty accusations like \"racism\", \"sexism\", \"X supremacy\", ... does just that.",
    "\"It's devastating...\" Where is your evidence for this hysterical fantasy? And why are you focused on alleged harms to blacks while neglecting potential (and far more likely, common sense would say) harm to other races?",
    "As it is though, mass media and the corporate world in general is quite full of such bosses, resulting in global cancellation also being common.",
    "Bigots exist and the sky is blue (usually, except when it's gray. YMMV). What's your point? Why get folks so worked up about it? Getting worked up about it is the source of cancel culture. Without these idiotic, irrational emotional reactions cancel culture would die.",
    "Canceling only requires one brainwashed boomer/genX boss with gut revulsion to hopelessly ambiguous and shifty weasel words describing largely harmless behavior, e.g. \"racism\", \"sexism\", ad nauseumism.",
    "Except when it's not. Why do people get so emotionally hung up over this? Gut revulsion to largely harmless nonsense is at base what cancel culture is all about: your Boomer/GenX bosses gets triggered by weasel words and fires you.",
    "I'm a minarchist, you mental child.",
    "That's what I thought. More brainwashed mental rubbish to block, sigh.",
    "Why do you have to hide behind Asians? Why can't you confront criticism of white people by actually talking about whites?",
    "Who held them back, and what specifically they do? Name names, places, and times or take your formless yet cliched nightmares out of my timeline.",
    "Since there are so many contradictory meanings of the quite vague and ambiguous concept of \"racism\" out there, why do you get so hung up and emotional about it?",
    "Why do you go by stomach feelings? Such e motionalirrationality is what is getting people fired.",
    "Why do you feel the need to cal people names? You are perpetuating cancel culture, not fighting it.",
    "The original tweet in this thread. Colin is canceling the black woman for \"racism\". That's the core taboo behind cancel culture.",
    "If white people followed her example it would destroy the vile taboos behind cancel culture.",
    "That's not the issue. The issue is the monstrous things he has been advocating.",
    "Or perhaps they have failed to educate you? Can you relate to us the results of long-term human safety studies on mRNA vaccines? Can you tell us about the differences between the ways proteins are presented to the immune system in mRNA vs. traditional vaccines?",
    "They know the idiotic taboos to pressure. The taboos belong to the bosses foremost. Otherwise the bosses would easily shut the miscreants up. Bosses tell their workers what to do,not the other way around. Don't let yourself get brainwashed into viewing reality backwards.",
    "Extremely false. It was ubiquitous. More common, and far more effective. Much less public. So effective that you never learned about it in the first place unless you were in the field. You missed out on a vast world of knowledge because its generators were canceled."
