    "I will strive to be less retarded, too. 😂",
    "I agree. But I know the builders are building. Will do more AMAs with founders who are building.",

    "Vitalik uses CEX sometimes, I think.",
    "That's what they say. 😂",
    "People have a misconception that I know a lot (or everything in crypto), but...",
    "I don't even trade on CEX much. I convert and hold. I have never used Binance Futures, Earn, Launchpad, Launchpool, etc. 🤷‍♂️ Shocking, right? I spend time building teams.",
    "Guys, don't take👇 too seriously. Was joking. But yes, it is my first time using an AMM, liquidity pool, etc. You may be shocked. But I never had to use a DEX before. I use CEX. 🤷‍♂️ I wanted to put a few BNB in TST LP, as a test. I seen demos of Pancake before. It looked so…",
    "That was my question. 😂 I don't know why it was failing. The error messages are sure intuitive \"Fail\". Maybe because the address is tracked by many bots trying to front run it, which may cause abnormal slippage.",
    "Thanks for supporting BNB! 😉",
    "I may have a slightly different opinion just about now. 😂",
    "It's the test token. Used to test. 😂",
    "27 minutes to do a test buy... Still haven't figured out how to add to the liquidity pool. And you have to do this while they are all watching on the blockchain. 😆"
