    "We could refer to them in another way: ‚Äúthe Lincoln assassin‚Äù or ‚Äúthe failed Trump assassin‚Äù. Don‚Äôt give them the name recognition they want.",
    "I believe we don‚Äôt (yet) have a complete understanding of physics, so it seems to me claiming that we‚Äôll be able to replicate a human brain assumes too much. Like if Isaac Newton claimed ‚Äúof course we could travel as fast as we like‚Äù because he didn‚Äôt know about relativity.",
    "Can I get in legal trouble if I give Ticketmaster a made-up social security number? (Asking for a friend, of course, I would NEVER lie to a big corporation who wants to know me better)",
    "No government agency should have the power to be legislator, judge, jury and executioner. Kudos to the Supreme Court for upholding our right to a trial by a jury of our peers!",
    "I am not a railgun developer, I just actually read the technical description of how proof of innocence works. And it DOES prevent bad actors from just moving funds to a new address; any move is seen by chainalysis and is reported to railgun via an API (that‚Äôs what the 1-hour‚Ä¶",
    "Looks like they‚Äôre good at predicting who wins, but not the over/under:",
    "I suspect a longtermist-EA would respond: do you think no one should think about the expanding universe and longer-term stuff? Wouldn‚Äôt that mean we should just stop worrying about things like climate change? (I‚Äôm not a longtermist; I think mostly focusing short-term is better)",
    "Almost as good as a nap in Lurelin Village",
    "That doesn‚Äôt sound like something I would say; I‚Äôm not a trader and don‚Äôt give trading advice. Where/when did I supposedly say that?",
    "I have no idea what this is, but they‚Äôre tagging me to try to leverage my reputation for their own gain. So they‚Äôre very likely some flavor of scam.",
    "Both sides of SO MANY controversies argue over false dichotomys. Are we collectively too dumb to process a statement like ‚Äúmasking seems to reduce r0 by about 20%‚Äù ?",
    "If you think hyper-smart machines will eventually be invented, do you think they will most likely:",
    "How much would it cost to build and launch a balloon that reaches the stratosphere and flys across the ocean? (Asking for a friend)",
    "Misleading headline that might cause real harm (if people think ‚Äúwhy bother to get vaccinated if mild cases get more long Covid‚Äù). Severe cases had a much higher chance of getting long Covid. (there are just a lot more mild cases to start with)",
    "Imagine the audience naked, then give in to peer pressure and strip before taking the stage.",
    "GiveDirectly because 1) they keep it simple and 2) they MEASURE their impact and focus on whatever is most effective.",
    "(purely hypothetical question, of course: I try to avoid doing things that make it likely I'll have to interact with the US legal system)",
    "The sanctions document talk about ETH and the ETH chain:",
    "If I've got some ETHW on the ETHPOW chain, would I violate the OFACT sanctions if I ran it through the Tornado contracts on the ETHPOW chain?",
    "I got happier when I decided there are multiple ‚Äúmeanings of life‚Äù, and it is ok to find meaning/purpose in several of them at once.",
    "My friend Jamie created a short video about the history of money and how it has evolved into Bitcoin; I thought you might enjoy it:",
    "I don‚Äôt trust my memories; I am just as susceptible to false memories as anybody, and I‚Äôve seen the research‚Äî eg",
    "You can trade ETH/ETHW/ETHS now on poloniex, but the markets for ETHW/ETHS are thin, so you can‚Äôt trade much without moving the price.",
    "Don‚Äôt take this as me endorsing the ETHW fork/chain; I think that‚Äôs a terrible idea that will cause even more confusion and hacks and scams and annoyance. I hope it dies quickly, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
